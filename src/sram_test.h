//! \defgroup classb_sram Internal SRAM Test
//!
//! \brief This self-diagnostic test checks the internal SRAM memory for coupling faults.
//!
//!  The test \ref classb_sram_test() divides the internal SRAM into \ref CLASSB_NSECS sections that are
//!  tested in turns with a March algorithm (see \ref marchx). The simplest behavior of the test
//!  is when there is no overlap between memory sections. In this case all sections have the same
//!  size, except possibly the last one (see \ref CLASSB_NSECS). The first memory section (referred to as
//!  the buffer) is reserved: it is used by the test to store the content of the other sections
//!  while they are being tested (for more details see \ref classb_buffer).
//!
//!  If there is overlap (see \ref CLASSB_OVERLAP), every time a memory section is tested a part of the
//!  previous section is tested as well. Note that this does not apply to the buffer, since it is
//!  the first section. The size of the buffer is then expanded with respect to the previous case.
//!  Further, the size of the second section is decreased correspondingly.
//!
//!  If there should be an error in internal SRAM the error handler \ref CLASSB_ERROR_HANDLER_SRAM()
//!  would be called.
//!
//!  \note Interrupts must be disabled during this test.
//!
//!  \section marchx March X
//!
//!  The chosen algorithm is <em>March X</em>. This consists on the following steps:
//!  \f[ \Updownarrow (w_\textbf{D}); \Uparrow(r_\textbf{D}, w_\bar{\textbf{D}}); \Downarrow (r_\bar{\textbf{D}}, w_\textbf{D}); \Updownarrow (r_\textbf{D}) \;,\f]
//!  where \f$w\f$ denotes a write operation, \f$r\f$ denotes a read operation,
//!  \f$\textbf{D}\f$ is any data background, \f$\bar{\textbf{D}}\f$ is the complement
//!  of \f$\textbf{D}\f$ and the arrows refer to the addressing order. In our implementation
//!  we have chosen \f$\textbf{D} = \text{0x00}\f$.
//!
//!  Under the restricted coupling faults (CFs) model, the interleaved organization of the memory
//!  in XMEGA avoids any kind of intra-word CFs. However, in order to detect some intra-word CFs
//!  that are not considered by this fault model, we have included the following optional march
//!  element:
//!  \f[ \Updownarrow (w_\textbf{D_0}, r_\textbf{D_0} \ldots w_\textbf{D_d}, r_\textbf{D_d}) \;,\f]
//!  where the background sequence is \f$\text{{0x00, 0xFF, 0x55, 0xAA, 0x33, 0xCC, 0x0F, 0xF0}}\f$.
//!  This intra-word test is only executed if \ref CLASSB_SRAM_INTRAWORD_TEST is defined. The elements
//!  that correspond to the first two data backgrounds are redundant because the first part of the
//!  test includes them. This optional test will detect all intra-word state CFs considered by the
//!  unrestricted CF model.
//!

//! \brief Number of sections the SRAM is divided into for testing.
//!
//! It is advisable that \c INTERNAL_SRAM_SIZE is divisible by the number of
//! sections and, therefore, recommended values are 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. Otherwise an extra
//! section will be added with the remainder of the division as size. Note that the higher
//! the number of sections the smaller the size of \ref classb_buffer, i.e. the section of memory
//! that is reserved for the test) and the faster each partial test is completed.
