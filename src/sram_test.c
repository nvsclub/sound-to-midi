	//! \brief Buffer of SRAM memory that is used to store the information from
	//! sections that are tested.
	//!
	//! The buffer is placed in the beginning of SRAM (see \c INTERNAL_SRAM_START). The size
	//! in bytes should be \c INTERNAL_SRAM_SIZE/CLASSB_NSECS+CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE. As an example, let us
	//! suppose the device has \c INTERNAL_SRAM_SIZE=4096 Bytes of SRAM, \ref CLASSB_NSECS = 8 and
	//! \ref CLASSB_OVERLAP=25. Given that the number of sections is a divisor of \c INTERNAL_SRAM_SIZE,
	//! there would be in principle exactly 8 sections, each with a size of 512 Bytes. For 25%
	//! overlap we need to extend the first section (the buffer) by 128 Bytes, and the second
	//! section is shortened accordingly. Therefore, we would have to reserve 512+128=640 Bytes for
	//! the buffer.
	//!
	//! The implementation depends on the compiler:
	//! For IAR it is easy because variables can be placed in a specific address using the a location
	//! pragma directive.
	//! For GCC the following steps should be followed:
	//!  - Firstly, it is necessary to define in <em> AVR/GNU C linker > Memory settings </em> a section
	//! that starts at \c INTERNAL_SRAM_START, for example:
	//! <tt> .classb_sram_buffer=0x2000</tt>.
	//!  - Secondly, the buffer variable has to be placed in that memory section. This can be done
	//! appending this to the definition of the variable:
	//! <tt> __attribute__ ((section(".classb_sram_buffer")))</tt>.
	//!  - Thirdly, the <tt>.data</tt> section has to be moved so that there is no overlap:
	//!  the start should be <tt>INTERNAL_SRAM_START + buffer_size</tt>. For example
	//!  640=0x280 and then we would set
	//! <tt> .data=0x2280</tt>.

/*! \brief This function executes March X test for a memory section at a time.
 *
 *  The test behaves as follows for a general section:
 *   - The size of the section is \c CLASSB_SEC_SIZE.
 *   - In order to have overlap between sections, the total number of bytes to be tested
 *   is <tt>CLASSB_SEC_SIZE + CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE</tt>.
 *   - The algorithm is set to start \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE bytes before the start of the current section,
 *   thus overlapping \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE bytes with the previous section.

 *  Special cases of memory sections are:
 *   - The first section to test is the buffer segment, which starts at \c INTERNAL_SRAM_START
 *  and ends at <tt>CLASSB_SEC_SIZE + CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE</tt>. In this case there is no previous segment, so no
 *  overlap is necessary. The total number of bytes tested is then the size of the buffer.
 *   - The second section to test is the first "data" memory section (i.e. the one after
 *  the buffer). The size of this section is <tt> CLASSB_SEC_SIZE - CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE</tt> (i.e. the size of
 *  this section was reduced in \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE bytes in order to expand the buffer by the
 *  same size). The test starts \c CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE bytes before the beginning of the section, and
 *  the total number of bytes tested is then \c CLASSB_SEC_SIZE.
 *   - The "remainder" segment, if any. This section has a size of \c CLASSB_SEC_REM, so the total
 *  number of bytes will be <tt>CLASSB_SEC_REM + CLASSB_OVERLAP_SIZE</tt>.

/*! \internal\brief This function executes the the March X algorithm in a section of
 * SRAM memory.
 *
 *  The following steps are followed:
 *   -# The content of the area to be tested is copied to the buffer. This does not
 *   apply when the buffer is tested.
 *   -# The March X algorithm is applied to the section to test for coupling faults.
 *   -# Memory content is copied back from the buffer. This does not apply when the
 *   buffer is tested.
 *
 *  This function requires that all variables are placed in registers by the compiler.
 *  This is achieved by using the \c register specifier (probably not necessary if the right
 *  level of optimization is chosen).
 *
 *  If there should be an error in SRAM a local variable (implemented in a register)
 *  would be flagged. This would lead to the error handler \ref CLASSB_ERROR_HANDLER_SRAM()
 *  being called.
 *
 *  \param p_sram    Pointer to first byte in memory area to be tested
 *  \param p_buffer  Pointer to first byte in the buffer
 *  \param size      Size of area to be tested in bytes.
